# Dog or Cat

This is a simple Flask app to predict if an image is a cat or a dog.
The predictor model is based on a convoluted neural network built using keras in tensorflow.

To run the app locally:

git clone git@github.com:dr-robin/dogcatpredictor.git
cd ./dogcatpredictor
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
